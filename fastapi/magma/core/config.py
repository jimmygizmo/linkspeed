#   Of all 3, option # 3 below is the best for simply creating and updating the DB of very simple apps.

# 1.  CREATE_ON_EACH_CALL
# For experiments, troubleshooting and special use cases. Warning this is extreme and triggers on every DB call.
# This should not hurt anything in most small applications but is not what you want for normal use.

# 2.  CREATE_ON_STARTUP
# For special use cases or as an interim solution; pre-Alembic. Warning this is crude and triggers on every DB startup.
# This should not hurt anything in most applications but is not at all optimal.
# This could work OK for small, simple apps, but not for commercial/larger apps.
# DB creation/initialization and data seeding as well as migrations forward and backwards will be handled by Alembic.
# Alembic is coming soon, but until it is added to Bedrock, this is a good option for creating/updating the DB schema:
CREATE_ON_STARTUP = True

# 3.  /scripts/init_db.py
# Prior to Alembic coming, there is another option for DB creation and it is perhaps preferable to the above 2 methods.
# Simply run the script:  /scripts/init_db.py
