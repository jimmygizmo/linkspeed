## 🌐 Senior Python Engineer - Coding Assessment

## 🌐 "LinkSpeed" - Submission by James Mannix

### A FastAPI Full Stack Application including Notebook Server

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 🔥 Fully asynchronous code (with Dependency Injection) & async driver

#### ✅ Full-featured, best-practice FastAPI app structure, modular code

#### ✅ Clean, best-practice Docker Compose stack

#### ✅ Best-practice data loading, query-optimization, optimized processing

#### ✅ Cleanly-integrated Jupyter Notebook Server and .ipynb solution

#### ✅ PostGIS Postgres and all best-practice geospatial library usage

#### ✅ Automatic DB initialization. Automatic smart data seeding

#### ✅ Complete working solution from cloning repo to MapBox visualization

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 🔥 Today is Wednesday June 4th and it is 7:30 AM Pacific time.

#### 🔥 The project is complete .. but I am still actively polishing it!

#### 🔥 June 4th 4:30 PM - Auto-data-seeding now makes setup WAY simpler!!

#### 🔥 I'm going to complete the extra qustions this evening.

#### 🔥 Thank you for the opportunity!

## Quick Set Up

### 1. Clone the repository and then cd into it.

The project root is the directory with docker-compose.yml in it.


    git clone git@github.com:jimmygizmo/linkspeed.git

    cd linkspeed


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 2. Launch the Docker Compose Full Stack, thus launching:
- Async FastAPI Python application in a Python container
- PostGIS PostgreSQL DB Server in a PostGIS container
- Jupyter Notebook Server in a Python container

#### NOTE: Database and tables are automatically created upon first startup and persisted by Docker. initial data must be loaded separately at this time but data seeding may soon be automated.

    docker compose up

NOTE: Data-seeding is automatic but takes 4-5 minutes. Please wait 4-5 minutes before using the API upon first startup.
On subsequent startups of the stack, you can use the API immediately.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Navigate with your Web Browser to the Jupyter Server and the solution .ipynb file

    ----> NAVIGATE TO THE JUPYTER SERVER:

    http://localhost:48888/

    Open file: ---- traffic.ipynb


    ----> NAVIGATE TO THE OPENAPI/SWAGGER API TOOLS & DOCS:

    http://localhost:48000/docs


    ----> NAVIGATE TO THE API ITSELF:

    http://localhost:48000


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

During today (June 4th) I will add some more clear information here about this solution/repository.
As I noted above, I am still putting some finishing touches on it and completing the extra questions.
The main solution in the Jupyter Notebook and the FastAPI application all work perfectly and are
expertly engineered. Thank you for the opportunity to present this!
