## Gold Mine of Modules - Ready for Release in June 2025

The following powerful modules and features are all completely or mostly mature in my prototype Mega Stack and
ready for release. Most or all will be added to Bedrock revisions here in early June 2025. Everything is under
the same MIT License. This is all totally free Open Source.

#### üî• Authentication and Single Sign On (SSO) with JWT, OAuth 2 and more

#### üî• Application building-block API endpoints with roles-base authorization

#### üî• NGINX 1.23 Reverse Proxy and Accelerator Cache (fastest static content delivery)

#### üî• NGINX SSL/Security configuration: Highest-possible rating of A++

#### üî• Redis cache, message queue and NoSQL store for acceleration, async processing

#### üî• Alembic for DB Migrations and high-quality mock-data seeding; developer friendly

#### üî• Premium React front end: TypeScript, React Router, Redux, Material UI

#### üî• Integration with Serverless PAAS like RunPod GPUs for AI/ML workloads

#### üî• AWS automation for Bedrock: Create, configure VMs. Deploy Bedrock easily

#### üî• Bedrock speaks REST by default but WebSocket and GraphQL modules are coming

#### üî• All free. All expertly crafted and integrated by a 20-year professional developer

## Quick Set Up

### Clone the repository and then cd into it.

You are now in the 'project root'. Most commands and actions, if not otherwise specified, should be done from this
directory. The project root is the directory with docker-compose.yml in it.

    git clone git@github.com:jimmygizmo/bedrock-gis.git

    cd bedrock

### Increase some directory permissions for database storage

(Needed for Windows WSL for sure and possibly others.) This command will give full permissions to the /dbvolume/
directory where the large DB file structure will be written by the PostgreSQL DB. You might have reasons later
to do something similar again and you might in some cases need to use sudo. This is needed because the docker process behind
Postgres is running at an elevated level. WSL handles this worse than macOS or Linux. Note that it is useful to
completely wipe out all persisted DB data to cause the DB to be re-created fresh, sometimes frequently, and this
is when you will most likely need those permissions. (I'll cover DB wiping during dev later.)

    sudo chomd -R 777 dbvolume 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Start The Bedrock-GIS Stack

On the first startup, Magma (the FastAPI Microservices Python app) will create all the database objects
including the logical database itself, if necessary. The stack should work immediately. If not, simply restart it.

    docker-compose up 

### Operate the API and auto-generated API documentation (OpenAPI and Redocly)

You access port 48000 on localhost, since we map the default FastAPI port 8000 to 48000 outside the container.
Bedrock always uses ports in the 40-thousand ranges when mapping outside the Compose stack:
5432 -> 45432. 443 -> 44443, 8000 -> 48000, 80 -> 44080, etc.

    For OpenAPI interactive docs and API tools, navigate to:
    https://127.0.0.1:48000/docs

    For Redocly interactive docs, navigate to:
    https://127.0.0.1:48000/redoc

    Use the REST API:
    https://127.0.0.1:48000/
    https://127.0.0.1:48000/users/

    * YES, ONLY ONE ENDPOINT WITH THE FIRST RELEASE - Auth and other basic endpoints will be added very soon!


### Shut down the stack

    hit ctrl-C    (in the same console)

## Development Environment

This section will soon get a lot of detailed and valuable information for Bedrock developers.

I use Pyenv for my virtual environments and this project containers a .python-version file specifying a virtual
environment from Pyenv with the name 've.gis' so I recommend you use all that and will provide good
instructions soon.

When you create ve.gis with Pyenv you want to use Python version 3.10.9 to match the Python image Bedrock uses
in the running container. (see bedrock/Dockerfile). You will want to use the requirements-pinned.txt file so that
all of your module versions in your local development environemt matches those in your deployed app.

    > pyenv install 3.10.9

    > pyenv virtualenv 3.10.9 ve.gis

    For the best Python installs/upgrades, always upgrade pip and setuptools in a fresh virtual environment.

    > pip install --upgrade pip
    > pip install --upgrade setuptools

    Install the large number of dependencies.

    > pip install -r requirements-pinned.txt

    Install the application module Magma itself.
    First cd into the bedrock container directory so you are in the same directory as setup.py
    You should then be inside /bedrock/bedrock/ (one-level deeper than the repo root of /bedrock/

    > cd bedrock
    > pip install .

This is important for running your Python code locally, outside of Docker, but it is equally important so your
powerful IDE with real-time analysis (such as PyCharm or VS Code) will operate properly and to its fullest potential.

I'm a hardcore developer and this project is for developers so you can expect this to be a rich and valuable section
of the docs for this project. I have a lot of strategic and tactical knowlege to pass on through this and other
projects of mine, especially with regards to architecture and development. It's all about the code so stay tuned for
lots of updates to this repo coming soon, valuable to my fellow developers most of all.
