## Quick Set Up

### Clone the repository and then cd into it.

You are now in the 'project root'. Most commands and actions, if not otherwise specified, should be done from this
directory. The project root is the directory with docker-compose.yml in it.

    git clone git@github.com:jimmygizmo/linkspeed.git

    cd linkspeed

    docker compose up

    NAVIGATE TO JUPYTER SERVER WITH THE SOLUTION .ipynb FILE:

    http://localhost:48888

    NAVIGATE TO THE OPENAPI/SWAGGER DOCS FOR THE AGGREGATES:

    http://localhost:48000/docs

    NAVIGATE TO THE API ITSELF:

    http://localhost:48000/


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

During today (June 4th) I will add some more clear information here about this solution.
As I noted above, I am still putting some finishing touches on it and completing the extra questions.
The main solution in the Jupyter Notebook and the FastAPI application all work perfectly and are
expertly engineered. Thank you for the opportunity to present this!
