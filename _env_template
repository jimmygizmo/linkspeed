# This file is used by python-dotenv and can be used by a Javascript ecosystem and other facilities as well.
# Python-dotenv can search UP the directory structure for a .env file and so it is best to keep this at the project
# root. Always make sure your .gitignore will KEEP THIS FILE OUT OF THE REPOSITORY. This is where you will configure
# your secrets and other sensitive data for your applications.
